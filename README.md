# APMonitor Local Server
Local server for Windows or Linux to run clients (Python, MATLAB, Julia) without an Internet connection. Another way to run locally but without a web server is to use the Python GEKKO package. Local optimization software is available for Linux and Windows but without certain solver options. Certain solver options require a license and cannot be distributed freely such as the Harwell Subroutine Library (HSL) with IPOPT. The local versions of IPOPT use the MUMPS linear solver.
